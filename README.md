# QA Testing Simulation - Jira Project

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project simulates the use of Jira in a QA testing workflow. It involves:
- Creating and managing Scrum-based sprints
- Adding testing tasks (manual and automated)
- Tracking progress using Jira reports
- Exporting the reports for review and analysis

The goal is to gain hands-on experience with Jiraâ€™s reporting features from a QA Engineerâ€™s perspective.

## ðŸ“Š Reports Included
1. **Sprint Report** (`Sprint_Report.pdf`)
   - **Purpose**: Shows which tasks were completed during the sprint and which were carried over to the next one.
   - **Insight**: Helps assess sprint success and backlog grooming needs.

2. **Velocity Chart** (`Velocity_Chart.pdf`)
   - **Purpose**: Summarizes how much work was completed across multiple sprints.
   - **Insight**: Helps estimate team capacity and adjust future sprint planning.

3. **Burndown Chart** (`Burndown_Chart.pdf`)
   - **Purpose**: Tracks remaining work over the sprint timeline.
   - **Insight**: Helps identify if the sprint is on track or at risk of falling behind.

## ðŸ“– How to Interpret the Reports

### Sprint Report
- Completed tasks are listed under **"Completed Issues"**
- Incomplete tasks under **"Issues Not Completed"**
- Useful for retrospective reviews

### Velocity Chart
- Bars represent story points completed per sprint
- Compare estimated vs completed work
- Fluctuations may indicate under- or over-estimation

### Burndown Chart
- The red line is the actual progress
- The grey/ideal line shows expected progress
- Gaps or upward spikes suggest delays or scope changes
